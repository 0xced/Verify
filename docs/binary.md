# Verification of binary data

Binary data can be verified by passing a stream to `VerifyBinary`.

<!-- snippet: VerifyBinary -->
<a id='snippet-verifybinary'/></a>
```cs
public async Task VerifyBinary(Stream input, string extension = "bin")
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/Verify.Xunit/VerifyBase_Stream.cs#L13-L15) / [anchor](#snippet-verifybinary)</sup>

A [Diff Tool](diff-tool.md) will only be displayed if one can be found that supports the defined extension.

The majority of diff tools require two files to render a diff. When doing the initial verification there is no ".verified." file available. As such when doing the initial verification an "empty file", of the specified extension, will be used. The list of supported empty file can be seen at [EmptyFiles](src/Verify.Xunit/EmptyFiles). If no empty file can be found for a given extension, then no diff will be displayed.
