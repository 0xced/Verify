# Diff Tool

Controlled via environment variables.

 * `VerifyDiffProcess`: The process name. Short name if the tool exists in the current path, otherwise the full path.
 * `VerifyDiffArguments`: The argument syntax to pass to the process. Must contain the strings `{receivedPath}` and `{verifiedPath}`.


## Visual Studio

```
setx VerifyDiffProcess "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"
setx VerifyDiffArguments "/diff {receivedPath} {verifiedPath}"
```
